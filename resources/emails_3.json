The frame has cracks, and one of the wheels wobbles constantly, making it unsafe to use. I rely on it daily to get to work and visit my family. A new one would cost $1,500, which I can’t afford on my income. Any help would mean the world to me.</p><p>Thank you for considering my request,<br>Emma Sullivan</p>"
