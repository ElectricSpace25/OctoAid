Donations were fairly stable last month, so we have a budget of $9,000. You can also still use any leftover funds from last month. Donations always go up around Christmas, so get excited for the budget next month!</p><p>Best regards,<br>OctoAid Manager</p>"

The frame has cracks, and one of the wheels wobbles constantly, making it unsafe to use. I rely on it daily to get to work and visit my family. A new one would cost $1,500, which I can’t afford on my income. Any help would mean the world to me.</p><p>Thank you for considering my request,<br>Emma Sullivan</p>"
